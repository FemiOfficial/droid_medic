                Note that sometimes this will not display if you have an active Wi-Fi connection.
                 If this is the case, turn Wi-Fi off and check back.
    
                </li>
                <li>
                If you don't see a signal data indicator, you may be in an area without coverage. If you can, move to a different area (for example, go outside) and check your signal again.
